    <h1 class="rainbow-text">DOGGOLINGO</h1>
    <p class="Paragraphe">DoggoLingo has taken the interwebs by storm in the last few years. Dog internet memes are everywhere and the 
        lingo that they’ve spawned has become unofficial language of dog lovers everywhere. It’s added proof that dogs 
        are now undisputed rulers of the net.

        But how well do you know what all these strange words actually mean? There are entire subreddits dedicated to 
        celebrating the unique qualities of a doggo versus a pupper, and so on. Naturally, there’s an effort to 
        distinguish blops from mlems and this has sometimes lead to disagreements or confusion. To set the record straight,
        scoured the web, checked the most reliable sources (aka: we’ve looked at a lot of very cute pictures of dogs) 
        to bring you this guide to internet dog jargon, or DoggoLingo for the initiated.</p>
